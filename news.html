This release includes several important improvements:
<br/>
<br/>

MartBuilder is now a fully featured application with enhanced layout for
schema transformation. It can also run in a server/client mode making
it possible to monitor the mart building process through a MartRunner
component.
<br/>
<br/>
MartView layout has been improved. Programmatic access has been extended to
include URL API functionality and mapping from XML queries to URL API. The
long outstanding problem with MartEditor templates has been fixed.

                <td  class="news_table" valign = "top"> <span class="pbold"> BioMart v 0.6 </span><br>

This release includes the following new features:

<br><br>
DAS server<br>
BioMart can now be used as a 1.5 DAS annotation server.
The server can be configured using standard BioMart
configuration tools without requiring to do any additional programming.

<br><br>
MartView<br>

MartView comes with an improved layout and better
interactivity.  The response times for the results panel
have been considerably improved for datasets with
large configuration, and the results come with
an 'unique rows' option. In addition to the
existing web service XML button, MartView now features
a Perl button which shows the query in Perl API format.

<br><br>
MartBuilder<br>

MartBuilder now allows you to execute, monitor and control your
transformation SQL remotely.  Improved schema diagrams provide
more compact overviews, and improved dataset diagrams provide
a clearer picture of the dataset structure. In addition, the user
has more options for modifying created datasets and better information
about them in 'explain dataset' and 'explain table' dialogs.

                <td class="news_table" valign = "top"> <span class="pbold"> BioMart v 0.5 </span><br>

The new release comes with a number of new features and improvements:

<br><br>

MartView <br>
BioMart web code has been re-implemented in order to make it easier to  
set
up and run queries. Filters and attributes now come in collapsible  
panels,
considerably improving the scalability of the interface. The handling of
two dataset queries has been much improved. It is now possible to  
combine
attributes as well as filters in such queries which makes it possible to
fully annotate a local dataset with a remote one. Customization of  
options
including colour schemes, result file handling, logging options etc is
much easier to manage in the new code. Finally it is now possible to use
the webcode with apache 2 as well as apache 1.



<br><br>

MartBuilder <br>
The first version of a new tool for creating BioMart compatible schemas
from existing relational data sources has been included in this release.
It makes the task of designing, creating and managing the schema
transformation straightforward. MartBuilder allows you to select the
central table of interest in a database and automatically design  
datasets
based around that central table. It follows the BioMart transformation
guidelines and naming conventions and will generate SQL statements that
you can execute to perform the actual transformation.


<br><br>

API <br>
The Web service and Perl APIs have been considerably simplified in terms
of user friendliness. The Perl API and Web service follow exactly the  
same
simple query building pattern used by MartView. In addition it is now
possible to find all the necessary attribute and filter internal names  
for
building a query with one click of the MartView XML button.

<br><br>
MartShell <br>
MartShell now comes with auto-completion and command line history on
linux, mac and windows.

A new BioMart web server has  been  set up in order to  keep
an up to date record of public datasets available in the BioMart format.
If you would like your site to be included please send us an email and we'll
hyperlink it from <a href="http://www.biomart.org">www.biomart.org</a> and include any additional information
e.g. pointers to database dumps etc.

<br>

The EBI BioMart server which until now has been used
for a similar purpose is going from now on to serve EBI datasets only.

This release includes the following new features:

<br><br>

 It is now possible to federate BioMart databases over port 80 which  
 overcomes any issues with direct RDBMS access and permits the use of 
BioMart remotely  
 without the need to either
 expose database servers to the outside world or open outgoing  
 connections through a firewall.
 This new feature takes advantage of the web service layer which has now  
 been exposed
 to  third party programmers. For more information see documentation.

<br><br>

 BioMart now supports restricted data access where different users can  
 see different parts of the data
 according to their privileges. This can be set on the dataset, table or  
 even individual column and/ or row level.
 It is an important feature in scenarios where different groups  
 collaborate on the same project  but have
 different level of access to a sensitive (e. g. clinical) data

MySQL, Oracle and Postgres.  Additionally, BioMart works with
the following  third party software: Bioconductor package biomaRt,
Taverna workflow system and DAS ProServer. <br><br>

The overall configurability of the system has been greatly improved.
It is now possible to run different dataset versions within the same
BioMart instance and have a customised remote dataset retrieval.
MartView has more configuration options and supports more filter
types. MartEditor comes with many usability improvements and
configuration validation preventing run time problems.<br><br>
